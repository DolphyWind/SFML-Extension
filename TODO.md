# Important
I am thinking to develop my own game engine. So I removed a lot of stuff from the list below. I may add new features and do bug fixes but I'll more focus on my own game engine.  

# TODO
+ [X] Redefine some constructors of sfex::Multitype
+ [X] Numeric/Vector<T, N> (N dimentional vectors)
+ [X] Add sfex::Math::SqrtTaker and various other functors to make Numeric classes and functions more flexible
