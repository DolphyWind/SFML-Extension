# TODO
+ Continue adding CTest tests
+ Last fixes, changes etc. before v1.0.0
+ Improve option manager. (Add ability to hold an option manager within an option manager and change how settings are saved and read. Make OptionValue be able to hold an option manager (I don't know if this is possible) and add to_string() method for stringifying an option manager)

# Ideas might get implemented
+ General/ParticleSystem
