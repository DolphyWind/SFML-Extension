# TODO
+ Use update based approach in sfex::Mouse, sfex::Mouse and sfex::Joystick
+ Add deltatime parameters to sfex::Scene::update()
+ Try to implement a Scene Node and a GameObject system. I wasn't gonna implement game objects but I've changed my mind. I have to be more systematic though.
+ General/Scheduler (A simple class that calls a specific function after x amount of time)
+ Math/Vector<T, N> (N dimentional vectors)
+ Math/Matrix<T, N, M> (NxM matrices)
+ Write a documentation after everything that got implemented.
+ Add a folder for InGame Elements
+ Whene loading a scene, create a new scene object and when destroying one destroy the object

# Ideas won't be implemented
