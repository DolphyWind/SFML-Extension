# TODO
+ General/Scheduler (A simple class that calls a specific function after x amount of time)
+ Math/Vector<T, N> (N dimentional vectors)
+ Math/Matrix<T, N, M> (NxM matrices)
+ Write a documentation after everything that got implemented.

# Ideas won't be implemented
+ GameObjects etc -> They have some problematic behaviours. I've actually tried to implement them before but it got messy.
