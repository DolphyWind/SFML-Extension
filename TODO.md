# TODO
+ Add CTest tests

# Ideas might get implemented
+ Numeric/Matrix -> Requires Numeric/Vector\<N,T\> to be implemented (N dimentional vectors)
+ Numeric/Quaternion -> I have to learn how quaternions represent 3d rotations.
+ Numeric/Math/Slerp -> Requires quaternions to be implemented
+ Add Managers/AnimationManager

# Ideas probably won't be implemented
+ Numeric/Random -> There are a lot of random libraries already written for C++
