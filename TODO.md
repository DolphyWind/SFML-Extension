# TODO
+ Redefine some constructors of sfex::Multitype
+ Try to implement a Scene Node and a GameObject system. I wasn't gonna implement game objects but I've changed my mind. I have to be more systematic though.
+ Numeric/Vector<T, N> (N dimentional vectors)
+ Numeric/Matrix<T, N, M> (NxM matrices)
+ Write a documentation after everything that got implemented.
+ Add a folder called InGame: Scenes, GameObjects, GameBehaviours, SceneNodes, GameComponents etc. will go there
+ When loading a scene, create a new scene object and when destroying one destroy the object
+ Rename Current Animation class to SpriteAnimation, Create a base class for Animations and add support for other types of animations
+ Make manager base inherit form std::unordered_map
+ Add typedefs to templated classes
+ Add sfex::Math::SqrtTaker sfex::Math::SquareTaker and various other functors to make math utilities more flexible

# Future Plans
+ Make renderer backend-agnostic
+ Support for 3D renderings
