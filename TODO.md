# Important
I am thinking to develop my own game engine. So some I removed a lot of stuff from the list below.  

# TODO
+ [X] Redefine some constructors of sfex::Multitype
+ [] Numeric/Vector<T, N> (N dimentional vectors)
+ [] Numeric/Matrix<T, N, M> (NxM matrices)
+ [] Add typedefs to templated classes
+ [X] Add sfex::Math::SqrtTaker and various other functors to make Numeric classes and functions more flexible

# Future Plans
+ [] Make renderer backend-agnostic
+ [] Support for 3D renderings
