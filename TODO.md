# Important
I removed a lot of stuff from the list below. Because I am thinking to develop my own game engine. I may add new features and do bug fixes, but I'll shift my focus on my own game engine.  

# TODO
+ [X] Redefine some constructors of sfex::Multitype
+ [X] Numeric/Vector<T, N> (N dimensional vectors)
+ [X] Add sfex::Math::SqrtTaker and various other functors to make Numeric classes and functions more flexible
+ [] SFML 2.6.x support
+ [X] Make ManagerBase inherit from std::unordered_map<std::string, T>
